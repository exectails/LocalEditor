LocalEditor
=============================================================================

Experimental editor for Mabinogi's localization text files. Loads them,
parses the lines as HTML, and picks out the actual translatable
parts of the lines, such as the title of a button.

With the hotkeys described below you can navigate the files very quickly
and immediately jump to the next part to translate, which is automatically
selected, allowing you to fully concentrate on the translation.

This is a prototype that I threw together for fun, and it hasn't been
extensively tested yet.

Controls
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page Up/Down: Navigate to next/previous line.
Tab: Nagivate to next translatable element.
